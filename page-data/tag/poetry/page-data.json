Hope you'll enjoy it :)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>##Of Jackdaw and Nightingale\r\nA big black bird sat on the ground and pondered. <br>\r\n'Pon grass so stark, day growing dark. <br>\r\n\"Am I content?\" He wondered and in his mind he saw a park. <br>\r\nA park so lush, of fruit aplenty. <br>\r\nWhere was no rush, all worries were empty. <br>\r\nHe sat on the grass, eyes but two slits, and drew a deep breath. <br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" He said as the day drew darker still. <br>\r\n\"You are what?\" Pierced the darkness. A tiny squeal.<br>\r\nWhat was that? Someone testing his wits? Or should he be afraid of death?<br>\r\nWith an open beak he scanned the trail to no success, his effort frail. Everything covered by a veil.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jackdaw. Frightened of me?\" came from ahead. And there she appeared, a Nightingale. <br>\r\n\"I fear naught.\" The Jackdaw cawed. <br>\r\n\"And do not disturb me. I'm enjoying my peace.\" But he felt a stir in his heart, soul growing with unease.<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" The Nightingale crooned and flew away, playful spark in her eye. <br></p>\n<p>A big black bird sat on the ground to ponder.<br>\r\nBut it wasn't himself which made him wonder.<br>\r\nIn his heart he felt a heat, a feeling he never knew.<br>\r\nSomething danced in the wind, mesmerizing and Jackdaw flew. <br>\r\nFloating on the rhythm of melody so sweet. He begun to sing out of the blue. <br>\r\nCaw! Went the bird and the ground was trembling; sending the night back into silence. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" He felt shame for causing the ending, causing such mess.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please continue.\" Came joyfully back to his address.<br>\r\nThe stir became a coal and that coal became fire. The other voice joined him, 'cept it was much higher.<br>\r\n\"I love your singing.\" Nightingale exclaimed. \"Wish I could hear some more, but I would be late.\" <br>\r\nShe thrust into the air. \"Goodbye Jackdaw.\"<br>\r\nHe picture her turn, flying away. <br>\r\nAnd the contentedness was gone. No more lush parks, days only shades of gray from this morning on. <br>\r\n\"No, wait! I wish to go with!\" <br>\r\nNightingale stopped. \"But it's too far a journey for you Jackdaw. And the sun there is always burning.\" <br>\r\nSure of his heart, there was no turning. <br>\r\n\"I have to at least try Nightingale!\"<br></p>\n<p>And thus they flew, higher and higher. And soon the world knew of their hearts desire.</p>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"title":"Of Jackdaw and Nightingale","slug":"jackdaw_and_nightingale","tags":[{"frontmatter":{"name":"Literatura","slug":"lit"}},{"frontmatter":{"name":"Poezie","slug":"poetry"}}],"feature_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5873015873015872,"src":"/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/4139b/drawing.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/35315/drawing.jpg 100w,\n/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/129d8/drawing.jpg 200w,\n/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/4139b/drawing.jpg 400w,\n/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/88367/drawing.jpg 600w,\n/static/c131b51033e40498739b4322438d663a/5c319/drawing.jpg 742w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}},"author":{"frontmatter":{"name":"Nick","profile_image":"/images/authors/author0.png"}}},"excerpt":"A little poem I've written a while ago.
